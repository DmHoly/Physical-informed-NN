# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

- This repository contains implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a recent approach that combines partial differential equations (PDEs) with deep neural networks to solve physics-related problems. PINNs incorporate physical laws (such as Navier-Stokes equations, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, etc.) directly into the training process of neural networks, reducing reliance solely on data.

### Repository Content
Implementation Scripts: Detailed examples of PINNs solving typical PDEs, such as the diffusion equation, Poisson equation, and Navier-Stokes equations.
Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive demos explaining step by step how PINNs can be used to model physical systems.
Documentation: A comprehensive guide explaining the working principles of PINNs, their mathematical formulation, and practical use cases.
